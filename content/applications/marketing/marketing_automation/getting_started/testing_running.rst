Testing & running a campaign
============================

Odoo gives users the ability to test marketing campaigns (and mailings) before officially running
them. 

First, open the :guilabel:`Marketing Automation` application and click on the campaign. Make sure
the campaign already has activities configured on it. To start a test, click the 
:guilabel:`Launch a Test` button at the top of the template form.

When clicked, a pop-up appears, in which the user can choose a specific record to run the test on,
or the user can create a brand new record to test.

Once the record is selected, click :guilabel:`Continue`, and Odoo will redirect to the campaign
test page.

Here, the name of the :guilabel:`Record` being tested is visible, along with the precise time this
test workflow was started. Beneath that is the first activity (or activities) in the workflow.

To start a test, click the :guilabel:`Run` icon beside the first activity in the workflow. When
clicked, the page will reload, and Odoo will show the various results (and analytics) connected to
that specific activity.

Once all the workflow activities are completed, the test will end and be moved to the
:guilabel:`Completed` stage. To stop a test before all the workflow activities are completed, click
the :guilabel:`Stop` button.
